# Any Time ATM

## Abstract

The ATM System is the project which is used to access their bank accounts in order to make cash withdrawals. Whenever the user need to make cash withdraws, they can enter their PIN number (personal identification number) and it will display the amount to be withdrawn in the form of 100’s 500’s and 1000’s. Once their withdrawn was successful, the amount will be debited in their account.
General Overview

The ATM will service one customer at a time. A customer will be required to enter ATM Card number, personal identification number (PIN) – both of which will be sent to the database for validation as part of each transaction. The customer will then be able to perform one or more transactions. Also customer must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card.

## System Analysis

Need For the Software:

Now a days every one very busy in their work.  So they feel that the job must be easier so the system is used to reduce their work which is done in the ATM system.  Instead of keeping lots of paper into a record or file and it may be missed somewhere so, this system help to keep the record of the customer it also keeps the details of he customer.  It is also easy to access.

Problem description :
The system mainly used by the bank clients.  When a client comes to ATM centre to update and delete their account.  It reduces the time consumption and lot of paperwork.  For any single operation it involves numerous references and updating also takes subsequent changes in other places.




## Feasibility Study

It includes the following-
1)	Technical Feasibility
2)	Economical Feasibility
3)	Operational Feasibility


1)	*Technical Feasibility:
Since the project is design with ASP.NET with C# as code behind and SQL server 2008 as backend, it is easy to install in the systems whenever needed. It is more efficient, easy and user friendly to understand by almost everyone. Huge amount of data can be handled efficiently using SQL server as backend. Hence this project has good technical feasibility. As per the technical aspect the project College Management System is technically suitable for the user as well as the developer.





2)	*Economical Feasibility:
Economic feasibility is mainly concern with the cost incurred during the implementation of the software. Since the project is developed using ASP.NET with C# and SQL server which is more commonly. It is financially feasible.  There is no need of spending over money.  Mainly this system constructed by existing devices only.  This project reduces the number of workers wage also.


3)	*Operational Feasibility:
As this ATM system is very easy to operate for the people and easy to use. So this project has a good operational feasibility.

Hence this project is technically, economically as well as operationally feasible.
